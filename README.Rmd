# wisclabread üçû

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of wisclabread is to centralize the WiscLab's functions for reading and
parsing data files.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wisclabread from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjmahr/wisclabread")
```
## Perceptual learning files

`read_wtocs_in_perceptual_learning()` will read in the WTOCS portion of a
`perceptual_learning` file and return a tibble.

```{r example}
library(wisclabread)
test_perceptual_learning <- file.path(
  "./tests/testthat/data", 
  "/0110_F_AAv01_perceptual_learning-0101010101.txt"
)

read_wtocs_in_perceptual_learning(test_perceptual_learning)
```
